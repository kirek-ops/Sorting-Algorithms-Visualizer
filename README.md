# Sorting-Algorithms-Visualizer
Implementation using C++ and SFML library. 

# First strategy for running program:
1. Copy all repository to your local folder
2. Move to this folder in terminal
3. Put this command to the terminal:
   g++ main.cpp Managers/Column.cpp Managers/EventMan.cpp SortingAlgorithms/bubble.cpp SortingAlgorithms/merge.cpp SortingAlgorithms/quick.cpp SortingAlgorithms/radix.cpp SortingAlgorithms/shell.cpp -o f -lsfml-graphics -lsfml-window -lsfml-system; ./f

Then you can see a file f. This is a executable file with Sorting Visualizer.
